He was in the mall one day and a gentleman asked if he was Santa. Ingram assured him that he wasn't and the gentleman suggested that he should be. That idea stirred in Ingram's head for a couple of weeks and he found his way to the Chattanooga Choo-Choo and into a Santa Suit. Ingram enjoys the excitement in children and adults alike as they live with childlike enthusiasm when they visit Santa Claus. "The best part is interacting with the children and the things that they say are really the darnedest things," Ingram says. Ingram also has musical talents and plays piano and organ for local churches and nursing homes. You can find Santa at the Chattanooga Choo-Choo and Bright School during the holiday season.</div></div></div></div></div><div id=flip class=container><div class="f-page f-cover"><div class=cover-elements><div class=f-cover-story><span>Billy & Julie <small>in</small></span>A Christmas Wish</div></div><div class=f-cover-flip><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Our family traditions were passed on and Christmas was no exception. The day we went to see Santa and tell him our wishes seemed to always be the same. Julie loved to help grandma and mom make cookies for Santa -- a few of his favorites; ginger snap, sugar and chocolate chip. I always helped grandpa and dad go to the local tree farm and choose the best tree to cut down and bring back home to decorate.</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">“Hurry, we’ll be late,” mom cried! “Make sure you’re wearing your best!” Julie and I rushed to get our clothes on and run down the stairs. “We’re ready,” we said cheerfully. Mother met us at the bottom of the stairs, brushed our hair from our faces, paused and smiled. “You two are beautiful,” she said while choking back tears, “now go get in the car, we’re going to be late!”</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Julie joyfully sang Christmas carols and awed at the elaborate decorations on all of the houses as we passed. I sat quietly and thought about what I was to ask Santa for Christmas this year. “We’re here,” mom said excitingly! “Let’s go inside and enjoy some cookies and milk while we wait for Santa to arrive.”</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">There were hundreds, if not thousands of other children there. In their Christmas finest, from the tiniest of babies to adults, they eagerly chattered and searched the room for that jolly old man dressed in red. Music filled the room and the smell of fresh pine trees, cookies and pies lingered in the air. I scanned the room and was amazed how many people were depending on that one man, the man to share their 30 second wishes with, the man who was claimed to grant every wish brought before him, the man who I so desperately hoped would grant mine.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Recently, I had become unsure if Santa was real. I had come to him every year, at this very spot, and shared my wish. He never failed me. Two years ago, I had a grand wish on my heart. I had a wish like I never had before and I had no doubts that he would deliver on his promise. But two years ago, I was let down, and again last year. I had made up my mind, I was going to give him one more chance.</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">I heard the door open, bells jingled, and everyone squealed with excitement. “Santa’s here,” Julie cried. She grabbed my hand and pulled me through the crowd of people. We made it to the candied fence just in time to watch Santa set his pack down next to his sleigh as he climbed in and sat down. He was so grand and mighty, but with a friendly face and a soft smile. He brushed his beard and began to see each child.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">I was so impatient. I couldn’t help but feel my stomach twisting into knots. Juile watched with adoration. “Billy,” she whispered, “look at him, he is so wonderful!” “Hmmm,” I said gruffly. “I guess so, he would be even more wonderful if he didn’t break his promise two years in a row.” “He will keep his promise this time Billy, I know he will,” Julie said with enthusiasm.</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">We were next. The elf opened the gate; Julie grabbed my hand and squeezed it. We walked calmly, but with eager hearts to his sleigh. He lowered his hand and helped us into he sleigh, one-by-one. Julie climbed into his lap quickly and I did the same.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">“Well hello there! How are my Julie and Billy doing this year?” I was anxious as I stared at him. “Great Santa! How have you been? How is Mrs. Santa, your reindeer and your other elves?” I sat quietly as Julie and Santa bantered on. “Well Julie, I have been wonderful! Everyone is doing very well and Mrs. Claus told me to give you a special hug today. I’m so happy to see you two this year!” “...and we’re happy to see you too Santa,” Julie exclaimed.</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">“Now what is it this year I can bring you?” There was a lump in my throat. Julie paused and looked at the sadness on my face, “Well Santa,” Julie started, “we…..” she held silent for a moment. “What is it Julie?,” questioned Santa.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Julie and I looked at each other with tears filling in our eyes, we looked at Santa, “We just want our dad back.” Tears rolled down our cheeks and Santa’s glasses began to fog slightly. Santa hugged us tightly and said, “I would love to bring him back for you.” He kissed both our heads and our mother came to hold us tightly.</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">“I think it’s time for us to go now kids,” she said hurriedly with a cracked voice.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=f-page><div class=container-fluid><div class=row><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Santa stepped down from his sleigh and kneeled down next to us. “You’re father will always be with you. He is the strength inside you, he’s that tickle on your nose when you sleep, he’s that gentle squeeze around your shoulders and he’s that soft kiss when the air brushes your face. When you are missing him, hold your arms like this...” as he hugged himself, “and squeeze tightly. He will feel you and know you are with him. Be brave my sweet Billy,” he whispered to me, “You will know his presence and have faith that you will be with him again.”</span></div></div></div><div class=col-sm-6><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-body><span class="text-18 text-SlateGray">Santa hugged us again and we walked away gripping mother’s hand ever so tightly. As we approached the door, I turned to see Santa’s face once more. Santa nodded and touched his nose. “Julie, you were right.” Billy said, “He will keep his promise.” “I know he will!” she assured him.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="f-page f-cover-back"><div class=f-cover-story><span>The End</span>Merry Christmas<br><br><span class=creditsspan>A Christmas Wish was written by Monique with the site design by Dwight.</span><br><a href=# class=creditos>View Full Credits</a></div></div></div><div id=titles><div id=credits><div id=the-end>A Christmas Wish</div><br><h1>Cast</h1><dl><dt>Santa<dd>Roy Ingram<dt>Writer<dd>Monique Wagner<dt>Designer<dd>Dwight Carroll</dl><h1>Images</h1><dl><dt>Cover<dd>http://www.pixabay.com<dt>Page 1<dd>http://www.flickr.com<dt>Page 2<dd>http://www.foter.com<dt>Page 3<dd>http://www.flickr.com<dt>Page 4<dd>http://www.flickr.com<dt>Page 5<dd>http://en.wikipedia.org<dt>Page 6<dd>http://www.sarcasticmom.com<dt>Page 7<dd>http://www.pinterest.com</dl><br><p>This site does not claim ownership of the images.
